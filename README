Net-Rexster-Client version 0.0.2

Net::Rexster::Client (see under http://search.cpan.org/~shoheik/)

One of the graphDB problem is that each graphDB has dialect and 
if you switch the database, you need to rewrite the code to adapt to the replaced db. 
Rexster(https://github.com/tinkerpop/rexster/wiki) is REST server for graph DBs 
which provides common interface for multiple graphDBs, so that the client of graphdb won't care which db is used. 
It enables us to use the same query to get/create/delete the nodes/edges even the graphDB is changed.

Net::Rexster::Cient is for Perl + GraphDB user.
